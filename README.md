Hello! Welcome to my Credit Card Application Prediction project.

In this project, I will be using machine learning to create a logistic regression model that will predict whether
a person's credit card application is approved. I will be using two datasets where applicants are matched by ID.
The features consist of the applicant's credit history as well as other social variables. 
I obtained this dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction)

I will be using Python with the scikitlearn framework and the following libraries: Pandas, SQLite3, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
